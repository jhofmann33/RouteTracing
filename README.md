# RouteTracing


This program is intended to visualize the path of traceroute to a handful of ip's & websites. 


An API key is required for the ipgeolocation.io site. This functionality from IPs_To_Location.py is for converting the IPs to the coordinate locations of themselves. The key is being piped in from an ignored file that is a simple get call. This is easy to manually overwrite with your own api key, or to recreate.
